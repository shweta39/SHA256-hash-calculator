# SHA256-hash-calculator
Bitcoins (seehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) are the most popular crypto-currency in common use. At their heart, bitcoins use the hardness of cryptographic hashing (for a reference seehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographichashfunction)to ensure a limited “supply” of coins.  In particular, the key component in a bit-coin is an input that, when “hashed” produces an output smaller than a target value.  In practice, the comparison values have leading  0’s, thus the bitcoin is required to have a given number of leading 0’s (to ensure 3 leading 0’s, you look for hashes smaller than0x001000... or smaller or equal to 0x000ff....The hash you are required to use is SHA-256.  You can check your version against this online hasher:http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator. For example, when the text “COP5615 is a boring class” is hashed, the value 0xe9a425077e7b492076b5f32f58d5eb6824b1875621e6237f1a2430c6b77e467c is obtained.  For the coins, you find, check your answer with this calculator to ensure correctness. The goal of this first project is to use F# and the actor model to build a good solution to this problem that runs well on multi-core machines.
